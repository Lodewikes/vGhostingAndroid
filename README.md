#### Description: 
Virtual squash ghosting application in android \
Shouts an area on the court at random for your ghosting session \

The application was written in java and consists of 3 activities. \
MainActivity.java controls the activity_main.xmml layout where all the settings for your session can be input.

If the countdown option is selected then the CountDownActivity.java activty is shown where a timer counts down from 10 to 0 at 1 second intervals.

Once the session starts on the GhostSession.java activity each set is started with a timer between each set at an input amount of time, counting down at 1 second intervals.

During each set a location (shot) is displayed and called out at random with an interval period of input time between each shot.
